# Introduction to this repository

This is a group of simulations and R scripts that I am testing out as part of an upcoming paper and presentation. We will define neural networks as elements of the following set:

$$
\mathsf{NN} = \bigcup_{L \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{l_1,l_2,\dots, l_L \in \mathbb{N}} \left( \times^L_{k=1} \left[ \mathbb{R}^{l_k \times l_{k-1}} \times \mathbb{R}^{l_k} \right]\right)
$$
